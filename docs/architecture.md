# System Architecture

## Overview

The NLP project follows a modular architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. The system is divided into several key components, each handling specific aspects of the NLP pipeline.

## Component Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- Located in `src/data_ingestion/`
- Handles multiple input formats:
  - HTML documents (`html_parser.py`)
  - PDF documents (`pdf_parser.py`)
  - Generic ingestion interface (`ingestion.py`)
- Provides unified data format for downstream processing

### 2. Preprocessing Layer
- Located in `src/preprocessing/`
- Text cleaning and normalization (`text_cleaner.py`)
- Handles:
  - Text normalization
  - Special character removal
  - Tokenization
  - Stop word removal
  - Lemmatization

### 3. Analysis Layer
- Located in `src/analysis/`
- Core NLP functionality:
  - Keyword extraction (`keyword_extraction.py`)
  - Semantic analysis (`semantic_analysis.py`)
  - Sentiment analysis (`sentiment_analysis.py`)
  - Topic modeling (`topic_modeling.py`)

### 4. Visualization Layer
- Located in `src/visualization/`
- Components:
  - Interactive dashboard (`dashboard.py`)
  - Report generation (`report_generator.py`)

### 5. Utility Layer
- Located in `src/utils/`
- Cross-cutting concerns:
  - Configuration management (`config.py`)
  - Logging (`logger.py`)

## Data Flow

```
[Input Data] → [Data Ingestion] → [Preprocessing] → [Analysis] → [Visualization]
                     ↑               ↑                  ↑              ↑
                     └───────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────┘
                                    Utility Layer
```

## Design Patterns

1. **Factory Pattern**: Used in data ingestion for creating appropriate parsers
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Implemented in analysis components for different algorithms
3. **Observer Pattern**: Used in visualization for real-time updates
4. **Singleton Pattern**: Applied to configuration and logging utilities

## Error Handling

- Each component implements its own error handling
- Errors are logged through the central logging utility
- Graceful degradation when specific features fail

## Configuration Management

- Environment-based configuration using `.env` files
- Hierarchical configuration system in `config/`
- Runtime configuration options through `utils/config.py`
